When I was a kid one of my favorite pastimes was to buy puzzles magazines to solve the problems.

Although I still like those magazines (there will always be a space in my heart for puzzles magazines) I have a slight preference today for solving problems using computers. 

This repository is where I store the solutions to the problems I solve. The solutions are always written as runnable programs in the language I think will give me more fun at that particular moment. The idea is just have fun, not to worry about language features, limitations, suitability, blablabla...
